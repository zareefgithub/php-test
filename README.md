# ans/pokédex

**This project will be based primarily on your ability to fulfill the task 
requirements. Any potential design skills are a bonus, but usability, 
performance and security will be taken into account.**


## Introduction
This project provides a starting point which will allow you to create your own 
web-based encyclopedia based on the popular franchise Pokémon - also known as 
a pokédex.


## Project Requirements
To get started, you'll need the following installed:
- PHP
- Composer
- Git
 
You are free to use whatever PHP packages and front-end libraries that you wish. We suggest to use the latest available version of Laravel. You are also welcome to use any CSS framework, like Tailwind.


## Task Requirements

For this challenge we require a web app in the form of a pokédex, allowing users
the ability to search for and display information for a specific pokémon.

A RESTful API is available at [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/) which will 
provide you with all the data that you will need. You do not need to create 
an account nor authenticate in order to consume the API, however please 
be aware that this API is rate-limited.
 
To get started, we have provided a skeleton folder structure, please create a 
fork of this repository either here on gitlab or via another public repository like github.

We recommend that you spend no more than two hours on this challenge, 
we are more interested in how you approach the task than spending lots of time on it.
