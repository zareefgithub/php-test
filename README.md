# ans/pokédex

**This project will depend on your ability to fulfil the task 
requirements. Any potential design skills are a bonus, but usability, 
performance and security will be taken into account.**


## Introduction
This project provides a starting point which will allow you to create your own 
web-based encyclopedia based on the popular franchise Pokémon - also known as 
a pokédex.


## Project Requirements

We would like to have this project completed in Laravel. You are welcome to use Docker.

Please use the latest version of Laravel available: ![Laravel](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/laravel/framework)

You can also utilise frontend frameworks like VueJS, React or utility frameworks like TailwindCSS. **Please bear in mind that design and integration of frontend frameworks is a bonus - we are not expecting you to do this**

## Task Requirements

For this challenge, we require a web app in the form of a pokédex, allowing users
the ability to search for and display information for a specific pokémon.

A RESTful API is available at [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/) which will 
provide you with all the data that you will need. You do not need to create 
an account nor authenticate to consume the API, however, please 
be aware that this API is rate-limited.
 
To get started, please fork of this repository either here on GitHub or via another public repository like GitLab.

We recommend that you spend no more than one hour on this challenge,
we are more interested in how you approach the task than spending lots of time on it.

Once the time is up, feel free to use comments/notes/pseudo code on how you would proceed further.
